# DocScout-MCP

![DocScout-MCP](docs/images/doc-scout-mcp-server.png)

DocScout-MCP is a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server written in Go that securely connects to your GitHub Organization, scans all repositories for documentation files, and provides intelligent context to AI Assistants (like Claude, Cursor, Antigravity, and others).

</div>

## Features

- **Automated Org-Wide Scanning**: Recursively searches repositories for documentation files. Target files and directories are fully customizable via environment variables.
- **Ownership Inference**: Automatically parses `CODEOWNERS` files to create `team` and `person` entities in the knowledge graph, with `owns` relations to the respective repositories — no manual configuration required.
- **Knowledge Graph Memory**: Built-in persistent memory powered by GORM (SQLite or PostgreSQL). AI agents can create entities, track relations, and add observations — surviving across sessions.
- **Content Caching**: Opt-in caching for file contents to speed up retrieval and offload GitHub API requests, integrating automatically with the indexing engine.
- **Flexible Transports & Security**: Supports both **Stdio** (default) and **Streamable HTTP** transports, with optional **Bearer Token Authentication** for HTTP.
- **Multi-Database Support**: Stores the knowledge graph in SQLite (file or in-memory) or PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL`.
- **Security First**: Defends against LLM hallucination and Path Traversal by _only_ allowing the AI to read files that were securely indexed as valid documentation.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Built in Go with goroutines and semaphores for high-performance concurrent scanning.
- **Works with Orgs & Users**: Automatically detects whether the configured owner is an Organization or a personal account.

## Tools Exposed

### Scanner Tools

1. `list_repos`: Lists all repositories that contain documentation files.
2. `search_docs`: Searches documentation files by matching a query against file paths and repo names.
3. `get_file_content`: Retrieves the raw content of a specific documentation file.

### Knowledge Graph Tools

4. `create_entities`: Create nodes in the knowledge graph.
5. `create_relations`: Create directed edges between entities.
6. `add_observations`: Append facts to existing entities.
7. `delete_entities`: Remove entities (cascades relations and observations).
8. `delete_observations`: Remove specific observations from entities.
9. `delete_relations`: Remove specific relations.
10. `read_graph`: Read the entire knowledge graph.
11. `search_nodes`: Search entities by name, type, or observation content.
12. `open_nodes`: Retrieve specific entities by name with their relations.

## Security & GitHub Tokens 🔒

To run this server, you need a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).
**DO NOT use a Classic Token with broad scopes!**

### How to Create a Secure Token:

1. Go to GitHub -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> [Personal access tokens (Fine-grained)](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).
2. Click **Generate new token**.
3. Under **Resource owner**, select your target Organization.
4. Under **Repository access**, select "All repositories" (or specific ones).
5. Under **Repository permissions**, grant **Read-only** access to:
   - `Contents`
   - `Metadata`
6. Generate the token and use it for the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

### 1. Running with Go (Stdio)

Requires Go 1.22+

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="github_pat_11A..."
export GITHUB_ORG="my-awesome-org"
export SCAN_INTERVAL="1h"

go run .
```

### 2. Running with HTTP Transport

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="github_pat_11A..."
export GITHUB_ORG="my-awesome-org"
export HTTP_ADDR=":8080"
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite://docscout.db"

go run .
# Server listening on http://localhost:8080
```

### 3. Running with Docker

```bash
# Stdio mode (default)
docker run -i \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN="github_pat_11A..." \
  -e GITHUB_ORG="my-awesome-org" \
  ghcr.io/your-username/docscout-mcp:latest

# HTTP mode with persistent SQLite
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN="github_pat_11A..." \
  -e GITHUB_ORG="my-awesome-org" \
  -e HTTP_ADDR=":8080" \
  -e DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///data/kb.db" \
  -v docscout-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/your-username/docscout-mcp:latest

# HTTP mode with PostgreSQL
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN="github_pat_11A..." \
  -e GITHUB_ORG="my-awesome-org" \
  -e HTTP_ADDR=":8080" \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@db-host:5432/docscout" \
  ghcr.io/your-username/docscout-mcp:latest
```

## GitHub Webhooks (Incremental Scanning)

By default, DocScout-MCP performs a full org scan on startup and repeats it at every `SCAN_INTERVAL`. **Webhooks are an optional enhancement** that trigger an immediate, targeted scan of a single repository the moment a relevant event is pushed — without waiting for the next full cycle.

### How It Works

When `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set, DocScout-MCP registers a `/webhook` endpoint (requires `HTTP_ADDR`). GitHub sends a signed `POST` request to this endpoint whenever a configured event fires. The server validates the `X-Hub-Signature-256` HMAC-SHA256 signature and, if valid, triggers a background scan of only the affected repository.

Supported event types:

| GitHub Event | Trigger |
| ------------ | ------- |
| `push` | A commit was pushed to a branch |
| `create` | A branch or tag was created |
| `delete` | A branch or tag was deleted |
| `repository` | Repository was renamed, archived, or visibility changed |

All other event types (e.g. `ping`, `star`, `issues`) are acknowledged with `200 OK` and ignored.

### Setup

1. **Start the server in HTTP mode** with the webhook secret:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="github_pat_11A..."
export GITHUB_ORG="my-awesome-org"
export HTTP_ADDR=":8080"
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite://docscout.db"
export GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET="a-strong-random-secret"

go run .
```

2. **Configure the webhook on GitHub**:
   - Go to your Organization → **Settings** → **Webhooks** → **Add webhook**
   - Set **Payload URL** to `https://your-host:8080/webhook`
   - Set **Content type** to `application/json`
   - Set **Secret** to the same value as `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
   - Under **Which events?**, select at minimum: `Pushes`, `Branch or tag creation`, `Branch or tag deletion`, `Repositories`
   - Click **Add webhook**

> **Note:** The `/webhook` path uses its own HMAC-SHA256 authentication and is excluded from Bearer Token auth (`MCP_HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN`). You do **not** need to pass a bearer token when GitHub calls this endpoint.

### Security

- Signatures are verified using `github.ValidatePayload` (constant-time HMAC comparison).
- Scans are dispatched asynchronously; the HTTP `200 OK` response is returned immediately to GitHub.
- Background scans are tied to the server's lifecycle context and are cancelled on graceful shutdown.

## Testing with MCP Inspector

The official [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) is the recommended tool for testing and debugging this server interactively. 

### Walkthrough

1. Ensure you have Node.js and `npx` installed.
2. Make sure you have built the project (`go build -o docscout-mcp .`) or have your go environment ready.
3. Run the Inspector using `npx`, passing your server execution command as an argument.

**Testing Stdio Transport (Default)**

```bash
# Using go run
GITHUB_TOKEN="github_pat_11A..." GITHUB_ORG="my-awesome-org" \
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector go run .

# Or using the compiled binary
GITHUB_TOKEN="github_pat_11A..." GITHUB_ORG="my-awesome-org" \
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector ./docscout-mcp
```

When the Inspector launches, it will securely start your DocScout-MCP server and display a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). Open this URL in your browser to access the interactive GUI. There you can verify connections, list the available Prompts, Resources, and Tools (like `list_repos`, `search_docs`, etc.), and test them out by filling their payload forms.
