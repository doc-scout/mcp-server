# DocScout-MCP

![DocScout-MCP](docs/images/doc-scout-mcp-server.png)

**Give your AI assistant a reliable map of your entire GitHub organization.**

An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server written in Go that continuously scans your GitHub org, builds a persistent knowledge graph from manifests and docs, and exposes it to Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI, and any other MCP-compatible AI — with zero hallucinations.

## The Problem

Your AI assistant knows nothing about your internal services. Every time you ask *"which teams own the payment service?"* or *"what breaks if I take down the DB?"*, it either **hallucinates** or **burns tokens** scanning dozens of repos.

DocScout-MCP solves this by pre-computing the answer graph and serving it deterministically over MCP.

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    GH["GitHub Org\n(repos, manifests, docs)"]
    S["Scanner\n(concurrent, retry-safe)"]
    P["Parsers\ngo.mod · pom.xml · package.json\nCODEOWNERS · catalog-info.yaml\nDockerfile · Helm · Terraform · OpenAPI"]
    G["Knowledge Graph\nSQLite · PostgreSQL"]
    AI["AI Clients\nClaude · Cursor · Copilot · Gemini"]

    GH -->|"GitHub API + Webhooks"| S
    S --> P
    P -->|"entities + relations"| G
    G -->|"23 MCP tools"| AI
```

1. **Scan** — Crawls every repo in your org: docs, manifests, infra files, and root tooling files. Repeats on a configurable interval and reacts to GitHub webhooks for instant updates.
2. **Parse** — Extracts services, owners, dependencies, and relations from `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, `package.json`, `CODEOWNERS`, `catalog-info.yaml`, and more.
3. **Graph** — Persists everything as entities and relations in SQLite or PostgreSQL, surviving restarts.
4. **Answer** — AI clients query the graph via 23 MCP tools. No file-reading loops, no token waste, no guessing.

## Why DocScout?

| Approach | Accuracy | Token Cost | Setup |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI reads files raw | Hallucination-prone | ~27,000/question | None |
| Backstage catalog | High (manual) | Medium | Heavy (infra team) |
| **DocScout-MCP** | **Verified (F1 1.00)** | **~290/question** | **5 minutes** |

DocScout pre-computes the answer graph from your repos so your AI never reads files to answer architecture questions. See [benchmark/RESULTS.md](benchmark/RESULTS.md) for methodology.

## See It In Action

> *"What happens if I shut down `component:db`? Which systems go offline, and who do I notify?"*

```
→ search_nodes("component:db")
  Found: component:db — incoming edge: payment-service depends_on

→ open_nodes(["payment-service"])
  Entity: payment-service (service)
  Observations: _source:go.mod, go_version:1.26, _scan_repo:myorg/payment-service

→ search_nodes("payments-team")
  Entity: payments-team (team)
  Observations: github_handle:@myorg/payments-team
  Relations: payments-team → owns → payment-service

Claude: "Shutting down component:db will impact payment-service.
         Notify @myorg/payments-team. No other services have a direct dependency."
```

The AI answers from **verified graph facts** — not file naming conventions or guesses.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get a Fine-Grained GitHub PAT

Go to **GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Fine-grained tokens**.
Grant **Read-only** access to `Contents` and `Metadata` for your org's repositories.

### 2. Add to Your AI Client

**Claude CLI (recommended):**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio \
  --env GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_... \
  --env GITHUB_ORG=my-org \
  docscout-mcp -- go run github.com/leonancarvalho/docscout-mcp@latest
```

**Or build and run locally:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leonancarvalho/docscout-mcp
cd docscout-mcp

GITHUB_TOKEN="github_pat_..." GITHUB_ORG="my-org" go run .
```

**Docker:**
```bash
docker run -i \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN="github_pat_..." \
  -e GITHUB_ORG="my-org" \
  ghcr.io/leonancarvalho/docscout-mcp:latest
```

### 3. Ask Away

> *"Which services depend on the billing library?"*
> *"Who owns the checkout service?"*
> *"List all repos with a Helm chart."*
> *"What Go services have direct dependencies on pgx?"*

## MCP Tools (23)

| Category | Tool | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Scanner** | `list_repos` | All repos with indexed files, filterable by type |
| | `search_docs` | Search file paths and repo names |
| | `get_file_content` | Raw content of any indexed file (path-traversal protected) |
| | `get_scan_status` | Scanner state, last scan time, cache size |
| | `trigger_scan` | Queue an immediate full scan without waiting for next interval |
| | `search_content` | Full-text search across cached docs (`SCAN_CONTENT=true`) |
| **Knowledge Graph** | `create_entities` | Add nodes to the graph |
| | `create_relations` | Add directed edges between nodes |
| | `add_observations` | Append facts to existing entities |
| | `update_entity` | Rename an entity or change its type atomically |
| | `read_graph` | Return the full graph |

## What Gets Scanned

**Root-level manifests** (extracted into the knowledge graph):

| File | Extracts |
|---|---|
| `catalog-info.yaml` | Backstage entity, lifecycle, owner, relations |
| `go.mod` | Module path, Go version, direct dependencies |
| `package.json` | Package name, version, runtime dependencies |
| `pom.xml` | Maven artifact, version, compile/runtime deps |
| `CODEOWNERS` | Team and person ownership per repo |
| `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.mise.toml` | Tooling presence |
| `README.md`, `openapi.yaml`, `swagger.json` | Documentation surface |

**Recursive directories**: `docs/` and `.agents/` (`.md` files) · `deploy/`, `infra/`, `.github/workflows/` (Helm, Terraform, K8s, workflows)

## Architecture & Security

- **Path-traversal protection**: Only files verified by the scanner are accessible. The AI cannot read arbitrary files.
- **STDIO safety**: No text is ever written to `stdout`. All logs go to `stderr`. Corruption of the JSON-RPC stream is impossible by design.
- **Rate limit resilience**: Every GitHub API call uses exponential backoff with smart `Retry-After` handling.
- **Graph integrity**: Observations are sanitized before storage. Mass deletions (> 10 entities) require explicit confirmation.
- **Audit log**: Every graph mutation emits a structured `slog` line to stderr.

For a deep dive, see [How It Works](docs/how-it-works.md).

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for completed features and upcoming work, including:

- **Semantic Search & RAG** — vector embeddings via `pgvector`
- **Custom Parser Extensions** — plug in new manifest formats without forking
- **Integration Topology Discovery** — Kafka, gRPC, HTTP call graph from config files
- **Multi-Cloud Adapters** — GitLab, Bitbucket, Confluence
- **Documentation Wiki (gh-pages)** — move the detailed guides to a dedicated GitHub Pages site
