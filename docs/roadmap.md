# Roadmap

This page tracks completed features and the path forward for DocScout-MCP.

For the full technical roadmap with implementation details, see [`ROADMAP.md`](https://github.com/leonancarvalho/docscout-mcp/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) in the repository.

## Completed

| # | Feature | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Incremental Ingestion (Webhooks)** | GitHub Webhooks trigger instant single-repo scans on push/create/delete events, bypassing the polling cycle. |
| 3 | **Rate Limiting & Resilience** | Every GitHub API call is wrapped with up to 3 retries: primary rate limit wait, abuse rate limit `Retry-After`, and exponential backoff for transient 5xx errors. |
| 6 | **Auto-Discovery (AST & Dependencies)** | Automatic service entity and dependency graph inference from `go.mod`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`, and `CODEOWNERS` — no Backstage catalog-info required. |
| 7 | **Deployment & Operations** | Multi-arch Docker image, docker-compose profiles, Kubernetes manifests, Helm chart v2, and Terraform module. |
| 8 | **Observability & Metrics** | Per-tool call counters and per-document access tracking via `get_usage_stats` tool and `/metrics` Prometheus endpoint. |
| 9 | **Knowledge Graph Protection** | Mass-delete guard (> 10 requires `confirm: true`), observation quality filter, and full mutation audit log to slog. |
| 10 | **Architecture Discovery & Content Search** | Auto-populates the knowledge graph from `catalog-info.yaml` (Backstage format). Opt-in full-text content search via `search_content`. |
| 11 | **Infra Asset Scanning** | Recursive scanning of `deploy/`, `infra/`, `.github/workflows/` for Helm, Terraform, K8s, and workflow files. |
| 12 | **Security Input Hardening** | Entity name validation, SQL LIKE wildcard escaping, whitespace-only query rejection, constant-time bearer token comparison, HTTP server timeouts. |
| 13 | **Custom Parser Extension** | `FileParser` interface and `ParserRegistry` allow custom manifest parsers to be plugged in without forking. Built-in parsers for go.mod, package.json, pom.xml, catalog-info.yaml, CODEOWNERS, AsyncAPI, Spring Kafka, OpenAPI, and Protobuf. |
| 14 | **Graph Traversal & Impact Analysis** | `traverse_graph` tool: server-side BFS with configurable direction, edge-type filter, and depth. Answers impact and ownership questions without loading the full graph. |
| 15 | **Integration Topology Discovery** | Five parsers (AsyncAPI, Spring Kafka, OpenAPI, Proto, K8s env vars) auto-populate producer/consumer and API edges. `get_integration_map` tool returns the complete integration topology of a service in one call with `graph_coverage` confidence field. |
| 16 | **Documentation Site (GitHub Pages)** | MkDocs Material site auto-deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`. |
| 17 | **FTS5 Full-Text Content Search** | Content search upgraded from SQL `LIKE` to SQLite FTS5 — BM25 relevance ranking, Porter stemmer, multi-word AND queries. Zero new dependencies. `search_mode` field in `get_scan_status` reports active engine. |
| 18 | **Graph Query Tools** | `list_entities` (filter by type), `list_relations` (filter by type and/or source), `update_entity` (atomic rename + reclassify with full relation/observation cascade), `find_path` (undirected BFS shortest path between any two nodes), `trigger_scan` (on-demand scan queuing with deduplication), and `entity_breakdown` breakdown in `get_scan_status`. |
| 19 | **File-Type Filters** | `list_repos` and `search_docs` accept an optional `file_type` parameter to narrow results to a specific document category (e.g. `openapi`, `asyncapi`, `proto`, `helm`). |

## Future Work

### Semantic Search & Vector Embeddings (RAG)

**Phase 2:** Integrate vector embeddings (`pgvector` for PostgreSQL or `sqlite-vss`) so AI agents can perform true semantic searches and find relevant docs even without exact keyword matches.

---

### Graph Knowledge Access Control (RBAC)

**Goal:** Role-Based Access Control so sensitive architectural or security documents are only accessible to authorized users or service accounts.

---

### Multi-Cloud and Platform Adapters

**Goal:** A generic Provider interface to support GitLab, Bitbucket, Confluence, Notion, and enterprise wikis alongside GitHub.
